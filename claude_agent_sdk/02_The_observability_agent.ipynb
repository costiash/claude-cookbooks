    "## Introduction to the MCP Server\n",
    "### 1. The Git MCP server\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first give our agent the ability to understand and work with Git repositories. By adding the [Git MCP server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/git) to our agent, it gains access to 13 Git-specific tools that let it examine commit history, check file changes, create branches, and even make commits. This transforms our agent from a passive observer into an active participant in your development workflow. In this example, we'll configure the agent to explore a repository's history using only Git tools. This is pretty simple, but knowing this, it is not difficult to imagine agents that can automatically create pull requests, analyze code evolution patterns, or help manage complex Git workflows across multiple repositories."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "We've demonstrated how the Claude Code SDK enables seamless integration with external systems through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Starting with local Git operations through the Git MCP server, we progressively expanded to full GitHub platform integration with access to over 100 GitHub-specific tools. This transformed our agent from a local assistant into a powerful observability system capable of monitoring workflows, analyzing CI/CD failures, and providing actionable insights for production systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "By connecting MCP servers to our agent, we created an autonomous observability system that monitors GitHub Actions workflows, distinguishes between real failures and security restrictions, and provides detailed analysis of test failures. The system demonstrates how agents can actively participate in your DevOps workflow, moving from passive monitoring to intelligent incident response.\n",
    "\n",
    "This concludes, for now, our journey through the Claude Code SDK tutorial series. We've progressed from simple research agents to sophisticated multi-agent orchestration, and finally to external system integration through MCP. Together, these patterns provide the foundation for building production-ready agentic systems that can handle real-world complexity while maintaining governance, compliance, and observability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You've Learned Across All Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "**From Notebook 00 (Research Agent)**\n",
    "- Core SDK fundamentals with `query()` and `ClaudeSDKClient`\n",
    "- Basic tool usage with WebSearch and Read\n",
    "- Simple agent loops and conversation management\n",
    "\n",
    "**From Notebook 01 (Chief of Staff)**\n",
    "- Advanced features: memory, output styles, planning mode\n",
    "- Multi-agent coordination through subagents\n",
    "- Governance through hooks and custom commands\n",
    "- Enterprise-ready agent architectures\n",
    "\n",
    "**From Notebook 02 (Observability Agent)**\n",
    "- External system integration via MCP servers\n",
    "- Real-time monitoring and incident response\n",
    "- Production workflow automation\n",
    "- Scalable agent deployment patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "The complete implementations for all three agents are available in their respective directories (`research_agent/`, `chief_of_staff_agent/`, `observability_agent/`), ready to serve as inspiration for integrations into your production systems."
