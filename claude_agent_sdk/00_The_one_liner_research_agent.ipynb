    "# Building a One-Liner Research Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "Research tasks consume hours of expert time: market analysts manually gathering competitive intelligence, legal teams tracking regulatory changes, engineers investigating bug reports across documentation. The core challenge isn't finding information but knowing what to search for next based on what you just discovered.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Claude Agent SDK makes it possible to build agents that autonomously explore external systems without a predefined workflow. Unlike traditional workflow automations that follow fixed steps, research agents adapt their strategy based on what they find--following promising leads, synthesizing conflicting sources, and knowing when they have enough information to answer the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "## By the end of this cookbook, you'll be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Build a research agent that autonomously searches and synthesizes information with a few lines of code\n",
    "\n",
    "This foundation applies to any task where the information needed isn't available upfront: competitive analysis, technical troubleshooting, investment research, or literature reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why Research Agents?\n",
    "\n",
    "Research is an ideal agentic use case for two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Information isn't self-contained**. The input question alone doesn't contain the answer. The agent must interact with external systems (search engines, databases, APIs) to gather what it needs.\n",
    "2. **The path emerges during exploration**. You can't predetermine the workflow. Whether an agent should search for company financials or regulatory filings depends on what it discovers about the business model. The optimal strategy reveals itself through investigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In its simplest form, a research agent searches the web and synthesizes findings. Below, we'll build exactly that with the Claude Agent SDK's built-in web search tool in just a few lines of code.\n",
    "\n",

    "## From Prototype to Production: Three Key Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "Our one-line research agent works, but it's limited. Single queries without memory can't handle iterative research (\"find X, then analyze Y based on what you found\"). Let's explore three ways we can further improve our implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Conversation Memory with ClaudeSDKClient**: Stateless queries can't build on previous findings. If you ask \"What are the top AI startups?\" then \"How are they funded?\", the second query has no context about which startups you mean. We can use `ClaudeSDKClient` to maintain conversation history across multiple queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. System Prompts for Specialized Behavior**: Research domains often have specific requirements. Financial analysis needs different rigor than tech news summaries. Use the system prompt to encode your research standards, preferred sources, citation format, or output structure. See our [agent prompting guide](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/tree/main/patterns/agents/prompts) for research-specific examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Multimodal Research with the Read Tool**: Real research isn't just text. Market reports have charts, technical docs have diagrams, competitive analysis requires screenshot comparison. Enable the `Read` tool so Claude can analyze images, PDFs, and other visual content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's implement these three changes for our research agent."

    "- The default `max_buffer_size` is 1MB (1,048,576 bytes)\n",
    "- Images are base64-encoded in messages, significantly increasing size\n",
    "- The chart image (~200KB on disk) becomes ~270KB+ when base64-encoded, plus message overhead\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    "Set `max_buffer_size` in `ClaudeAgentOptions` to a higher value (e.g., 10MB) when working with images or large tool outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best practices:**\n",
    "- Set buffer size based on your use case: 10MB for typical multimodal work, higher for large document processing\n",
    "- Consider if you really need to pass full images - sometimes descriptions or smaller thumbnails suffice\n",

       "<li><strong>Gap: 19.8 percentage points</strong> (largest gap in the chart)</li>\n",
       "<li>This is the most striking difference—Claude Code is used nearly <strong>2.5x more</strong> for startup work compared to Claude.ai. This suggests Claude Code's coding capabilities are particularly valuable for startup developers.</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<h4>3. <strong>Enterprise Work</strong> - Relatively Balanced</h4>\n",
       "<ul>\n",

       "<li><strong>Claude Code</strong>: 23.8%</li>\n",

       "<li>Both platforms see similar enterprise usage, with Claude.ai slightly ahead.</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<h4>4. <strong>Educational Uses</strong> - Claude.ai Leads</h4>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li><strong>Tutorial or Learning</strong>: Claude.ai (12.2%) vs Claude Code (0.7%) — <strong>17x higher on Claude.ai</strong></li>\n",
       "<li><strong>Academic Research</strong>: Claude.ai (11.9%) vs Claude Code (2.2%) — <strong>5x higher on Claude.ai</strong></li>\n",
       "<li><strong>Coursework</strong>: Claude.ai (4.9%) vs Claude Code (0.4%) — <strong>12x higher on Claude.ai</strong></li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
       "<p>This shows that Claude.ai is strongly preferred for learning and educational purposes, likely because its conversational interface is more accessible for non-developers and students.</p>\n",
       "<h4>5. <strong>Open Source Projects</strong> - Low but Similar</h4>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li><strong>Claude Code</strong>: 4.0%</li>\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Built\n",
    "\n",
    "In this cookbook, you built three progressively sophisticated research agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stateless research agent - One-line queries for independent research tasks\n",
    "- Stateful agent with memory - Multi-turn investigations that build on previous findings\n",
    "- Production module - Reusable research functions for integration into applications\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use stateless queries (query()):**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Independent research questions\n",
    "- Parallel processing of unrelated tasks\n",
    "- Scenarios requiring fresh context each time\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use stateful agents (ClaudeSDKClient):**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multi-turn investigations building on previous findings\n",
    "- Iterative refinement of research\n",
    "- Complex analysis requiring sustained context\n",
    "\n",
    "Research agents excel when information isn't self-contained and the optimal workflow emerges during exploration—competitive analysis, technical troubleshooting, literature reviews, and investigative journalism all fit this pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "This foundation in autonomous research prepares you for enterprise-grade multi-agent systems. In the next notebook, you'll learn to:\n",
    "\n",
    "Orchestrate specialized subagents under a coordinating agent\n",
    "Implement governance through hooks and custom commands\n",
    "Adapt output styles for different stakeholders (executives vs. technical teams)\n",
