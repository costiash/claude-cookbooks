    "# Building a One-Liner Research Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "Research tasks consume hours of expert time: market analysts manually gathering competitive intelligence, legal teams tracking regulatory changes, engineers investigating bug reports across documentation. The core challenge isn't finding information but knowing what to search for next based on what you just discovered.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Claude Agent SDK makes it possible to build agents that autonomously explore external systems without a predefined workflow. Unlike traditional workflow automations that follow fixed steps, research agents adapt their strategy based on what they find--following promising leads, synthesizing conflicting sources, and knowing when they have enough information to answer the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "## By the end of this cookbook, you'll be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Build a research agent that autonomously searches and synthesizes information with a few lines of code\n",
    "\n",
    "This foundation applies to any task where the information needed isn't available upfront: competitive analysis, technical troubleshooting, investment research, or literature reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why Research Agents?\n",
    "\n",
    "Research is an ideal agentic use case for two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Information isn't self-contained**. The input question alone doesn't contain the answer. The agent must interact with external systems (search engines, databases, APIs) to gather what it needs.\n",
    "2. **The path emerges during exploration**. You can't predetermine the workflow. Whether an agent should search for company financials or regulatory filings depends on what it discovers about the business model. The optimal strategy reveals itself through investigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In its simplest form, a research agent searches the web and synthesizes findings. Below, we'll build exactly that with the Claude Agent SDK's built-in web search tool in just a few lines of code.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Our one-line research agent works, but it's limited. Single queries without memory can't handle iterative research (\"find X, then analyze Y based on what you found\"). Let's explore three ways we can further improve our implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Conversation Memory with ClaudeSDKClient**: Stateless queries can't build on previous findings. If you ask \"What are the top AI startups?\" then \"How are they funded?\", the second query has no context about which startups you mean. We can use `ClaudeSDKClient` to maintain conversation history across multiple queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. System Prompts for Specialized Behavior**: Research domains often have specific requirements. Financial analysis needs different rigor than tech news summaries. Use the system prompt to encode your research standards, preferred sources, or output format. See our [agent prompting guide](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/tree/main/patterns/agents/prompts) for research-specific examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Multimodal Research with the Read Tool**: Real research isn't just text. Market reports have charts, technical docs have diagrams, competitive analysis requires screenshot comparison. Enable the `Read` tool so Claude can analyze images, PDFs, and other visual content.\n",

    "**Best practices:**\n",
